# model-fitting
The Model Fitting App is currently available for Windows and Mac users.
Instructions:
Click the green "Code" button and "Download Zip". Unzip the file and run the installer. Please see the Youtube tutorials below for help. If you still have questions, feel free to reach out to me by email (kevin-robben@uiowa.edu) or through the "Discussions" Github page.

Note that installing the Model Fitting GUI App does not require MATLAB, but the installer will install MATLAB Runtime which is free of charge. However, running or editing the actual source code will require MATLAB R2020a, or newer, which does require a license.
